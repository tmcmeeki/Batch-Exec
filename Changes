Revision history for Perl extension Batch::Exec.

TO-DO:
	- Error registration and suppression (avoid duplicates, e.g. c2a
	  issues this: WARNING command returned no output
	- LOV _default and _random does not work for the non-BE classes,
		it tries to modify the BE class instead.  Consider
		and internal structure simlar to _lov itself.

	- modify parent methods to cater to "default" entries per DN_DRIVE_DFL below.
	- have a shell default for platform,

	- c2a command should cough after readpipe
		- should also capture or bury stderr as an option (if possible).
