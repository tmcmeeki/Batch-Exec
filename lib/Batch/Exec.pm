Batch::Exec - Batch executive framework: common routines and error handling

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Batch::Exec;
  blah blah blah

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The batch executive is a series of modules which provide a framework for
batch processing.  The fundamental principles of the executive are as follows:

=item a.  Log it.

Provide as much detail as possible about what step you are up to and what
you're trying to do.

=item b.  Check it.

Don't keep processing if the last command fails.  Always check that the
last step succeeded.

=item c.  Tidy it.

If you're creating a bunch of temporary files to assist with processing, then
eventually you'll need to clean up after yourself.

=back

This framework applies wrapper routines to existing perl modules and functions,
and attempts to provides for a more consistent experience
for batch scripting, execution and debugging.  Whilst the bulk of handling is
geared at convenience (e.g. avoiding repetitive error checking and logging),
there are some very specific functions that form part of good batch 
frameworks, such as semaphore-controlled counting.

The batch executive comprises the following modules:

B<Batch::Exec>	(common routines and error handling)

B<Batch::Log>	(logging and debugging message handling)

B<Batch::Counter>	(semaphore-controlled access to counter files)

B<Batch::Temp>	(temporary file and directory creation and purge).

The Batch::Exec module provides a very simple series of functions, and the 
basis for the other modules in this series.  Specifically, it covers
shell execution and status checking, along with file/directory creation 
and deletion.  It comprises the following attributes and methods:

Remove the file or directory specified from the filesystem, i.e. unlink or
this module's rmdir() function.

Attempt to run the command (arguments starting with EXPR2) via readpipe().
EXPR1 is the retry count (which defaults to 1).  Output can be stored in
the ARRAY_REF, if needed for subsequent processing.  The echo attribute
allows output to be logged.

multiple directories.

	my $dn = shift;

	return 0 if (-d $dn);

	$self->_log->info("creating directory [$dn]");
